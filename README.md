## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app or any additional context you'd like to add.

There were some challenges in understanding how npm build works, and how it duplicates the public folder of client/ to server/ . It was also a bit difficult to understand how to use PicoCSS since I had never used it before. I enjoyed making this app a lot, even though I was incredibly busy this week and couldn't finish it on time.
